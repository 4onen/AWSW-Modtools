n "Today I got a diary to note things in. I guess I should start off gently, talking about myself."
n "Some would call me an inventor. I don't really agree with that. I'm just good at taking ideas and bringing them into our world."
n "Our current project is to streamline the entire hospital process for our kind. The current tools and equipment available for use are almost completely incapable of accomodating us, as if designed for another species entirely."
n "This can be seen in almost every aspect of our lives - our tables, chairs and even toilets."
n "Some would say they were designed for humans. Our ancestors were obsessed with them, some of us still are. It saddens me that these views are still prevalent, especially in the positions that matter most: our government and academics."
n "I'm lucky to be a group of scientists where these views are considered antiquated by all and actively moving forwards."

n "Day two"
n "So I got this diary yesterday. It's growing on me already. Or not. It's weird to write stuff in there. I'm really not sure why I got it at all. Impulse I guess."
n "Anyway, there was talk at work about a new politician. The usual discussions - how they were going to ruin the economy, education, all of it. Someone said they'd heard that the person in question had just bought the position. I wouldn't put it past politicians. Rotten to the core, the lot of them."
n "Her name was Emera. I'd say even the name sounds bad but I'd not stoop that low, except for maybe here. Her policies were interestingly similar to the status quo. I guess I'll have to see if there's a proper correlation."

n "Day three"
n "Today's my official day off work. I call it one of my unpaid work days, as in reality I just spend my time jotting notes and calculations. Not that I mind at all, if I didn't want to do it, I wouldn't."
n "In two days, our project will be going to an expert panel to decide if we're going to get further governmental funding. As much as we all dislike it, we've got to go for it; there's little to no funding out there otherwise."
n "I detest how little our species seems to care about our own technological advancement with only a few individuals willing and able to contribute to making everyone's lives easier."

n "Day four"
n "At my second day off, I'm bored stiff. I'm at a mental block with work and need to discuss it properly with someone to work out the finer details."
n "I hope we'll have it all completely ready by the time we enter the office where we'll be getting judged by the fact checking committee, if not, then it's back to the drawing board for several months whilst we go over their feedback and cover the holes."
n "At least we have a fair chance with them. They seem to do a pretty good job at knowing when a project is fleshed out enough to work out - almost everything that gets funded goes to completion without too much hassle and bad turns."
n "They give decent feedback as well, especially with what's not quite thought out as well as it could be."
n "Even though they're called the fact checking committee, our team at least hasn't had to worry about getting the facts wrong, at least for a very long time."

Ry "Hello, you're Amelia, aren't you? Representing the project on redesigning equipment used for hospitals?"
Amelia "Yes and yes."
Ry "Would you like to explain your project?"

Amelia "Well, we start off with the context: the equipment we use is badly designed for our kind."
Amelia "Especially so in hospitals - where every mistake can be fatal."
Amelia "Redesigning even the beds so they can be used on a subject lying face up would be a significant improvement."
Amelia "In their current state, only furred dragons, runners and certain flyers can really use them. Earth dragons simply can't or their spikes will embed in the mattress."
Amelia "Even in those that can physically use them, many report pain if they repeatedly do so, presumably due to the lack of tailorship in design to their subspecies."
Amelia "Our project aims to help by recreating equipment fit for purpose."
Amelia "We need funding for our project so we can afford both to build prototypes as well as the final designs."
Amelia "We also need to educate doctors and practitioners on how to use the products once the design is finalised."
Amelia "Having people die due to untrained professionals is unacceptable so we'd need additional funding to help fight against that."
Amelia "We propose to completely redesign medical equipment, beyond the simple such that they can be effectively used."
Amelia "Our technological advancements will help to make this a reality. Just recently, a method for injecting directly into the bloodstream was discovered without damaging our outer scales."
Amelia "Making this sort of thing available to the sector in general cheaply will vastly increase the survival rate."
Amelia "Damaged scales can and do easily cave in on themselves, causing massive bleeding if they hit arteries."
Amelia "Preventing this will significantly increase the lifespan of those who require minimal amounts of surgery."
Amelia "I think that's all for now"

n "We discussed it and decided that to move forwards, we'd have to tighten our scope. We can probably get the next grant for the less taxing things like just reshaping equipment to be ergonomic."
